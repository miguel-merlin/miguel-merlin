### About me
Currently pursuing a major in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics at Stevens Institute of Technology, where I'm diving deep into the world of algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving.

Last summer, I had the incredible opportunity to join the Amazon.com team as a Software Engineer Intern. I played a pivotal role in developing cutting-edge solutions, learning from some of the best minds in the industry, and contributing to projects that impact millions of users.

I am passionate about the potential of Machine Learning, as I'm currently engaged as a Student Researcher, exploring the frontiers of AI in healthcare and environmental sustainability. My research spans across multiple domains, including:

Predicting Consciousness in ICU Patients: Leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to provide critical insights for medical professionals, aiding in patient care and recovery.

Carbon Gas Behavior Simulation: Exploring the dynamics of carbon gas for effective carbon sequestration solutions, contributing to a greener, more sustainable future.

Detection of Depression through Biomarkers: Utilizing the power of data and bioinformatics to identify and understand minor and major depression, paving the way for more accessible mental health diagnostics.

Additionally, I currently serve as the Vice President of Technology at Blueprint Stevens, where we are dedicated to making a meaningful impact by developing software applications for non-profit organizations. In this role, I lead our talented teams of developers, making critical software architecture decisions to create innovative solutions that help our non-profit partners achieve their missions.

I'm passionate about innovation and the transformative potential of technology. Let's connect and explore opportunities to collaborate, learn, and make a positive impact in the world through the fusion of computer science, mathematics, and cutting-edge research.

Feel free to reach out, and let's explore the exciting possibilities that lie ahead!
